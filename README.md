  # üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
Hey there! I'm Paul Stone, and I believe in a "bottom to top approach" to understanding and building things. This approach means delving deep into the foundations to understand how things work under the hood, enabling me to create and innovate from the ground up.

üöÄ My journey into the world of computers was ignited by Charles Petzold's "![Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319)" and further fueled by "![Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X/ref=sr_1_16?crid=II70D88QMHZY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.OLtzg7Js_-ernO7qBB2OY7BEq4hiLAM83Wr4M345O7RvgGDp2qNkXbHGvpNw1vZjgjQ0k9d87r2ZktjQEFeBbHo5pYvInmrU8caAqfGlw6-CzOGZD-eidmHpbiYJviCmNmEXyo2F705Z1MtkONKGe__dvCn2WGDe6fzoziVRJ9ik7-WYAVAnpRDsrNyh_v23ZYBB9IDXqv0IxuF5jpMi7kM-CJ0RrWB_AkQ-unEx1JI.9P75P-BQm1FCJbEN-l1suAQdXtN8yIkpEjJD9_I16Qs&dib_tag=se&keywords=Computer+Systems%3A+A+Programmer%27s+Perspective&qid=1708296295&s=books&sprefix=computer+systems+a+programmer%27s+perspective.%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C350&sr=1-16)." These books opened the doors to a self-driven exploration of the intricate world of computers, a journey I've never regretted embarking on.

üß† Constantly sharpening my programming skills, I made a conscious choice to break free from the tutorial cycle and relearn math and physics from scratch. Starting with the basics of arithmetic, I've been implementing and experimenting with various mathematical and physical concepts. Some might call it reinventing the wheel, but I firmly believe that true knowledge comes from understanding and the realization of necessity.

üè´ Interestingly, I didn't have a fondness for math during my school days. It wasn't until I grasped its significance as the language of the Universe that I truly appreciated its value. "Math is the language of the Universe" - a phrase that resonates deeply with me and fuels my continuous exploration of its boundless applications.

üìö Aside from my passion for technology and mathematics, I'm an avid reader. I find solace in collecting books and often find myself lost in the stories they hold. Books, with their ability to teach, heal, and inspire, are a testament to the power of human connection through storytelling. They have the remarkable capacity to guide us, expand our imagination, and offer solace in the darkest of times.

üíª I firmly believe that computers are direct reflections of our imagination - a medium through which our ideas come to life and open new vistas for exploration. Much like books, they enable us to rediscover and reimagine the world around us. Never underestimate the power of reading and the boundless possibilities it holds.
